# thanos compact --help
usage: thanos compact [<flags>]

Continuously compacts blocks in an object store bucket.

Flags:
      --block-meta-fetch-concurrency=32
                                Number of goroutines to use when fetching block metadata from object storage.
      --block-sync-concurrency=20
                                Number of goroutines to use when syncing block metadata from object storage.
      --block-viewer.global.sync-block-interval=1m
                                Repeat interval for syncing the blocks between local and remote view for /global Block Viewer UI.
      --block-viewer.global.sync-block-timeout=5m
                                Maximum time for syncing the blocks between local and remote view for /global Block Viewer UI.
      --bucket-web-label=BUCKET-WEB-LABEL
                                Prometheus label to use as timeline title in the bucket web UI
      --compact.cleanup-interval=5m
                                How often we should clean up partially uploaded blocks and blocks with deletion mark in the background when --wait has been enabled. Setting it to "0s" disables
                                it - the cleaning will only happen at the end of an iteration.
      --compact.concurrency=1   Number of goroutines to use when compacting groups.
      --compact.progress-interval=5m
                                Frequency of calculating the compaction progress in the background when --wait has been enabled. Setting it to "0s" disables it. Now compaction, downsampling and
                                retention progress are supported.
      --consistency-delay=30m   Minimum age of fresh (non-compacted) blocks before they are being processed. Malformed blocks older than the maximum of consistency-delay and 48h0m0s will be
                                removed.
      --data-dir="./data"       Data directory in which to cache blocks and process compactions.
      --deduplication.func=     Experimental. Deduplication algorithm for merging overlapping blocks. Possible values are: "", "penalty". If no value is specified, the default compact
                                deduplication merger is used, which performs 1:1 deduplication for samples. When set to penalty, penalty based deduplication algorithm will be used. At least one
                                replica label has to be set via --deduplication.replica-label flag.
      --deduplication.replica-label=DEDUPLICATION.REPLICA-LABEL ...
                                Label to treat as a replica indicator of blocks that can be deduplicated (repeated flag). This will merge multiple replica blocks into one. This process is
                                irreversible.Experimental. When one or more labels are set, compactor will ignore the given labels so that vertical compaction can merge the blocks.Please note
                                that by default this uses a NAIVE algorithm for merging which works well for deduplication of blocks with **precisely the same samples** like produced by Receiver
                                replication.If you need a different deduplication algorithm (e.g one that works well with Prometheus replicas), please set it via --deduplication.func.
      --delete-delay=48h        Time before a block marked for deletion is deleted from bucket. If delete-delay is non zero, blocks will be marked for deletion and compactor component will
                                delete blocks marked for deletion from the bucket. If delete-delay is 0, blocks will be deleted straight away. Note that deleting blocks immediately can cause
                                query failures, if store gateway still has the block loaded, or compactor is ignoring the deletion because it's compacting the block at the same time.
      --downsample.concurrency=1
                                Number of goroutines to use when downsampling blocks.
      --downsampling.disable    Disables downsampling. This is not recommended as querying long time ranges without non-downsampled data is not efficient and useful e.g it is not possible to
                                render all samples for a human eye anyway
      --hash-func=              Specify which hash function to use when calculating the hashes of produced files. If no function has been specified, it does not happen. This permits avoiding
                                downloading some files twice albeit at some performance cost. Possible values are: "", "SHA256".
  -h, --help                    Show context-sensitive help (also try --help-long and --help-man).
      --http-address="0.0.0.0:10902"
                                Listen host:port for HTTP endpoints.
      --http-grace-period=2m    Time to wait after an interrupt received for HTTP Server.
      --http.config=""          [EXPERIMENTAL] Path to the configuration file that can enable TLS or authentication for all HTTP endpoints.
      --log.format=logfmt       Log format to use. Possible options: logfmt or json.
      --log.level=info          Log filtering level.
      --max-time=9999-12-31T23:59:59Z
                                End of time range limit to compact. Thanos Compactor will compact only blocks, which happened earlier than this value. Option can be a constant time in RFC3339
                                format or time duration relative to current time, such as -1d or 2h45m. Valid duration units are ms, s, m, h, d, w, y.
      --min-time=0000-01-01T00:00:00Z
                                Start of time range limit to compact. Thanos Compactor will compact only blocks, which happened later than this value. Option can be a constant time in RFC3339
                                format or time duration relative to current time, such as -1d or 2h45m. Valid duration units are ms, s, m, h, d, w, y.
      --objstore.config=<content>

      --retention.resolution-1h=0d
                                How long to retain samples of resolution 2 (1 hour) in bucket. Setting this to 0d will retain samples of this resolution forever
      --retention.resolution-5m=0d
                                How long to retain samples of resolution 1 (5 minutes) in bucket. Setting this to 0d will retain samples of this resolution forever
      --retention.resolution-raw=0d
                                How long to retain raw samples in bucket. Setting this to 0d will retain samples of this resolution forever
      --selector.relabel-config=<content>
                                Alternative to 'selector.relabel-config-file' flag (mutually exclusive). Content of YAML file that contains relabeling configuration that allows selecting blocks.
                                It follows native Prometheus relabel-config syntax. See format details: https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/configuration/#relabel_config
      --selector.relabel-config-file=<file-path>
                                Path to YAML file that contains relabeling configuration that allows selecting blocks. It follows native Prometheus relabel-config syntax. See format details:
                                https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/configuration/#relabel_config
      --tracing.config=<content>
                                Alternative to 'tracing.config-file' flag (mutually exclusive). Content of YAML file with tracing configuration. See format details:
                                https://thanos.io/tip/thanos/tracing.md/#configuration
      --tracing.config-file=<file-path>
                                Path to YAML file with tracing configuration. See format details: https://thanos.io/tip/thanos/tracing.md/#configuration
      --version                 Show application version.
  -w, --wait                    Do not exit after all compactions have been processed and wait for new work.
      --wait-interval=5m        Wait interval between consecutive compaction runs and bucket refreshes. Only works when --wait flag specified.
      --web.disable-cors        Whether to disable CORS headers to be set by Thanos. By default Thanos sets CORS headers to be allowed by all.
      --web.external-prefix=""  Static prefix for all HTML links and redirect URLs in the bucket web UI interface. Actual endpoints are still served on / or the web.route-prefix. This allows
                                thanos bucket web UI to be served behind a reverse proxy that strips a URL sub-path.
      --web.prefix-header=""    Name of HTTP request header used for dynamic prefixing of UI links and redirects. This option is ignored if web.external-prefix argument is set. Security risk:
                                enable this option only if a reverse proxy in front of thanos is resetting the header. The --web.prefix-header=X-Forwarded-Prefix option can be useful, for
                                example, if Thanos UI is served via Traefik reverse proxy with PathPrefixStrip option enabled, which sends the stripped prefix value in X-Forwarded-Prefix header.
                                This allows thanos UI to be served on a sub-path.
      --web.route-prefix=""     Prefix for API and UI endpoints. This allows thanos UI to be served on a sub-path. This option is analogous to --web.route-prefix of Prometheus.
